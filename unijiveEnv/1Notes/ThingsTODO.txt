THings TO Do:



-make sure that the database checks that the input data is already in the database
    -ex)in users chats, shouldnt be allowed to add chat if you're already in the chat


-create separate messages table for each chat
    -ex) messages are ordered as a whole and not corresponding to their specific chat 
    -ex) currently would have to order by timestamp
        -would be easier if messages from same chat were in same table so they can be ordered  
         by existing message id
